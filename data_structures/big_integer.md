# Big Integer

A data structure that allows the representation and manipulation of arbitrarily large integers in computer programs. In most programming languages, the size of an integer is limited by the number of bits available in a machine word. For example, a 32-bit machine can represent integers up to 2^31-1, while a 64-bit machine can represent integers up to 2^63-1. However, there are many applications that require the manipulation of integers larger than these limits.

To work with larger integers, a big integer data structure is needed. Big integers are typically implemented using arrays of digits or words, where each element of the array represents a portion of the integer. The number of digits or words used to represent the integer depends on its size.

Unfortunately, `c++` does not have a built-in feature for handling big integers. For this data structure, it is recommended to use `python` or `java`. `Python` has built-in features for handling big integers.
